<h1>Push swap</h1>
4th project on the 42 cursus

<h3>Objectives>
<p>
The objectif of this project is always a very important stop in a developer's journey. It is often the first encounter with the concept of complexity.
Sorring algorithms and their complexity are part of the classic questions discussed during job interviews. It's probably a goodtime to look at these concepts since you'll have to face them at some point.
The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C, and usee of basic algorithms, especially focusing on their complexity.
Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. Especially because from on integers configuration to another the most efficient sorting solution can differ.

  <h3>Stack</h3>
  <p>
    A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed (Lifo-last in firt out/Filo-first in last out)
